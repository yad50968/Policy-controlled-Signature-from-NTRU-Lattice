This software is a computer program which purpose is to provide to the
research community a proof-of-concept implementation of the Policy-controlled
signature from NTRU lattices, described in the NTMS2018 paper
"Policy-controlled signature from NTRU lattices", of
Zi-Yuan Liu, Jen-Chieh Hsu, Raylin Tso
